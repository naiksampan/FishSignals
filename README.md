# Fish Classification Using Signal Data with PCA and K-Means

This repository presents an unsupervised learning approach for classifying fish species based on signal data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering are leveraged to achieve dimensionality reduction and clustering, respectively.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes signal data representing fish characteristics and applies unsupervised learning techniques to identify and classify fish into distinct groups. This approach helps uncover patterns and insights in the data without requiring labeled samples.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Signal data is preprocessed for normalization and removal of noise to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is employed to reduce the high-dimensional signal data into lower-dimensional components, retaining significant variance.
- **Clustering**: K-Means is used to cluster fish data into groups, aiding in classification based on signal characteristics.
- **Visualization**: Results are visualized in a 2D/3D space to illustrate clustering and group separation.
